[SAVE BUTTON]save list back to a json in the format specified in 
	saveButton action listener will be saving to JSON

[comboBox] SORTING( then put options in the dropdown menu )

i am not going to change the ID field to String because the return value would be messed up and we would have to change a ton of code
	if you want to change it, feel free, but tbh if we lose a few points for it, we lose a few points
